# AutoML-pipeline
Contains Python scripts that intend to automate the process from the raw data to the final model in machine learning.
Currently, this is work in progess, which means the documentation is poor and the scripts can contain errors. However, I intend to provide a very good documentation and to iteratively refine the scripts and find possibly bugs.
